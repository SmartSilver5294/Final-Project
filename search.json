    "text": "Have you ever been tired or fed up with traffic congestion delays and are just dying to get out? I’ve been exploring the different traffic congestion levels all around Massachusetts in January of 2024, using a data set from Mass.gov. Today, I have compiled the data into an interactive graph that lets you see the traffic congestion levels in most of the cities within MA. I also made another graph about the Jan 2024 Massachusetts census data to compare the congestion levels to the population. I have found that the highest levels of congestion are near Cape Cod, while the lowest congestion levels are closer to the middle and eastern sides of the state. Feel free to look around and enjoy!"
